# Google-meet-automation
Automated google meet meetings using python.

I have scripted the code in such a way that, i dont have to remember the daily schedule or to look at the given timetable daily for my classes . 
The code is done according to a specific timetable. So if someone want to use then they have to change the code accordingly.
## what steps it go through:
* Firstly it will open a new tab and the link mention in the code inorder to open gmail.
* Then it will automatically enter the gmail and the password.
* Then will reach to the google meet tab and will enter the specific class code according to the given timetable.
* Afterwards when the meeting is about to start it will close the microphone and camera and will join the meeting.
* The work is not yet finished it will also end the meeting automatically according to the time set given in the timetable section.
